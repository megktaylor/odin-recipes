        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>1 lemon</li>
                <li>8oz pasta</li>
                <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
                <li>1 cup whole milk ricotta</li>
                <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp fresh cracked pepper (or to taste)</li>
                <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper (or to taste)</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Zest and juice the lemon. You'll need about ½ tsp zest and 1 Tbsp lemon juice.</li>
                <li>Cook the pasta according to the package directions (boil for 7-10 minutes, or until tender). Before draining, reserve about 1 cup of the starchy water from the pot.</li>
                <li>Place frozen peas in the colander before draining the pasta so the pasta will thaw the peas as it drains</li>
                <li>Add the butter and minced garlic to a large skillet and saute over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic is fragrant</li>
                <li>Add the drained pasta and peas and about 1/2 cup of the starchy pasta water to the skillet with the butter and garlic. Stir to combine, then turn off heat.</li>
                <li>Add the ricotta, Parmesan, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and ½ teaspoon lemon zest to the skillet. Stir until everything is well combined, the residual heat from the skillet and pasta have warmed the ricotta, and the ricotta has formed a creamy sauce. Add more of the warm reserved pasta water if needed.</li>
                <li>Season the pasta with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste. Serve warm.</li>

                </ol>
