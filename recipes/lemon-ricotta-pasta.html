        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A quick and light pasta to make on busy nights. Creamy ricotta with a pop of bright freshness from the lemon</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>1 lemon</ul>
            <ul>8oz pasta</ul>
            <ul>1 cup frozen peas</ul>
            <ul>1 clove garlic, minced</ul>
            <ul>1 Tbsp butter</ul>
            <ul>1 cup whole milk ricotta</ul>
            <ul>1/4 cup grated parmesan</ul>
            <ul>1/4 tsp salt (or to taste)</ul>
            <ul>1/4 tsp fresh cracked pepper (or to taste)</ul>
            <ul>1 pinch crushed red pepper (or to taste)</ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

            <ol>Zest and juice the lemon. You'll need about ½ tsp zest and 1 Tbsp lemon juice.</ol>
            <ol>Cook the pasta according to the package directions (boil for 7-10 minutes, or until tender). Before draining, reserve about 1 cup of the starchy water from the pot.</ol>
            <ol>Place frozen peas in the colander before draining the pasta so the pasta will thaw the peas as it drains</ol>
            <ol>Add the butter and minced garlic to a large skillet and saute over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic is fragrant</ol>
            <ol>Add the drained pasta and peas and about 1/2 cup of the starchy pasta water to the skillet with the butter and garlic. Stir to combine, then turn off heat.</ol>
            <ol>Add the ricotta, Parmesan, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and ½ teaspoon lemon zest to the skillet. Stir until everything is well combined, the residual heat from the skillet and pasta have warmed the ricotta, and the ricotta has formed a creamy sauce. Add more of the warm reserved pasta water if needed.</ol>
            <ol>Season the pasta with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste. Serve warm.</ol>
