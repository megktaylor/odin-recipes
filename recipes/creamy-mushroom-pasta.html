        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Pasta tossed in a silky sauce with lots of mushrooms</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>160g/6oz fettuccine</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp (30g) unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1/2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>300g/10oz mushrooms, sliced</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (125mL) white wine</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (125mL) chicken or veggie broth/stock, low sodium</li>
                <li>3/4 cup (185mL) heavy whipping cream</li>
                <li>1/3 cup (30g) parmesan finely grated, plus more for serving</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp salt and pepper, each</li>
                <li>Parsley, roughly chopped for serving</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Cook pasta in salted water for 1 minute less than time per packet (start this mid mushroom cook). Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup cooking water, then drain.</li>
                <li>Melt butter and heat oil in a large skillet over high heat.</li>
                <li>Add mushrooms and cook, stirring regularly. When they start to sweat, add a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>When pretty golden (about 4 - 5 minutes), add garlic and cook until garlic is golden and mushroom is golden.</li>
                <li>Stand back and add wine (it will be steamy!!), stir, scraping the bottom of the skillet. Simmer rapidly until wine is mostly evaporated and winey smell is gone.</li>
                <li>Add broth, cream, parmesan, salt and pepper. Stir to dissolve parmesan and simmer for 2 minutes, stirring regularly.</li>
                <li>Transfer pasta into sauce, toss for 1 - 2 minutes until sauce thickens and coats pasta. If sauce gets too thick (rather than slick, see video), add a splash of reserved pasta cooking water.</li>
                <li>Garnish with parsley and serve immediately with extra parmesan!</li>
            </ol>
